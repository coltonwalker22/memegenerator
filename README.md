React.js application that helped me understand the useState hook.
the full CRUD applicaton allows you to get a random meme image, and apply your own text.
You saved it! want to change the text? Or just get rid of it? No problem! 
I was proud of getting this to work, and hope you can see my effort and what I was going for!
